# itanic_Dataset_Project
[Overview]
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more. The project is a part of a data science learning journey and focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.
#Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset available on Kaggle. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including survival status, demographics, and ticket details.
# Features in the Dataset:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Ticket fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
  [Objectives]
1. Understand the dataset: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and missing values.
2. Preprocess the data: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features and select important ones.
4. Model Building: Train machine learning models to predict survival.
5. Evaluation: Compare model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
# Tools_and_Libraries
The project uses the following tools and libraries:
Python
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Steps in the Project
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the distribution of features.
Visualize relationships between features and survival.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked).
Scale numerical features (e.g., Fare, Age).
3. Feature Engineering
Create new features like "FamilySize" or "Title".
Drop irrelevant or redundant columns.
4. Modeling
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
5. Evaluation
Evaluate models using confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, and other metrics.
Results
Achieved a 80+% accuracy using the best-performing model (e.g., Random Forest).
Identified key factors influencing survival, such as gender, passenger class, and age.
Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of feature engineering and data preprocessing in improving model performance. Future improvements may include advanced hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, or using deep learning techniques.
